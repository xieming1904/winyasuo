# Unpack - Design Documentation

## Overview

Unpack is a modern file compression and decompression utility designed for Windows. It aims to provide a minimalist, intuitive, and powerful user experience by leveraging Microsoft's Fluent Design System. Unpack is envisioned to seamlessly integrate with the Windows environment, offering both a user-friendly graphical interface and a robust command-line interface for advanced users and automation.

This repository contains the comprehensive design documentation for the Unpack application, covering its core concepts, user interface (UI), user experience (UX), advanced features, AI-driven functionalities, and cloud service integrations.

## Design Philosophy

The design of Unpack is guided by the following core principles:

*   **Minimalist & Intuitive:** A clean, uncluttered interface that is easy to understand and use, focusing on essential functionality without overwhelming the user.
*   **Fluent Design:** Full adherence to Microsoft's Fluent Design System to ensure a native look and feel on Windows, including support for light and dark modes, appropriate use of materials (Mica, Acrylic), motion, and typography (Segoe UI Variable).
*   **Efficiency & Power:** Providing users with powerful tools for managing archives quickly and effectively, catering to both novice and advanced users.
*   **Seamless Integration:** Offering deep integration with Windows Explorer via context menus and a powerful CLI for scripting and automation.
*   **Intelligent Assistance:** Incorporating AI-driven features to simplify complex tasks and provide smart recommendations.
*   **Cloud Connectivity:** Enabling users to interact with their cloud storage services directly from within the application.

## Design Documents

The detailed design specifications for Unpack are organized into the following documents:

1.  **[Unpack - Core Concept and UI Design.md](./Unpack%20-%20Core%20Concept%20and%20UI%20Design.md)**
    *   Overall application concept and goals.
    *   Application of Fluent Design principles.
    *   Textual mockups and descriptions for the main user interface (Light and Dark Modes).
    *   Textual mockups and descriptions for Windows Explorer context menu integration.
    *   A core user flow diagram (textual flowchart) for compression with password protection.

2.  **[Unpack - Advanced Features Design.md](./Unpack%20-%20Advanced%20Features%20Design.md)**
    *   Research summary on common implementation approaches for advanced archiving features.
    *   Detailed textual mockup of the "Create Archive" dialog, including General, Advanced, Password, Split/SFX, and Comment tabs.
    *   Textual mockup of the in-archive file preview interaction within the main UI.
    *   Core Command-Line Interface (CLI) command list, syntax, and examples.

3.  **[Unpack - AI and Cloud Features Design.md](./Unpack%20-%20AI%20and%20Cloud%20Features%20Design.md)**
    *   Research summary on implementation aspects and UX patterns for AI and Cloud features.
    *   Textual mockup of the "Smart Preset" UI and notification wording (AI-driven compression suggestions).
    *   Textual flowchart for the "Cloud Decompression (Google Drive to Google Drive)" user flow, including OAuth concepts.
    *   Conceptualization of potential business models for the Unpack application.

## How to Use This Documentation

*   Start with the **Core Concept and UI Design** document for a foundational understanding of Unpack's look, feel, and basic interactions.
*   Refer to the **Advanced Features Design** document for details on more complex functionalities and the command-line interface.
*   Explore the **AI and Cloud Features Design** document for insights into intelligent assistance, cloud service integration, and potential monetization strategies.

Each document contains textual descriptions intended to be detailed enough for UI/UX designers and developers to create visual mockups, prototypes, and plan implementation.

## Next Steps (Conceptual)

Following the completion of this design documentation phase, the project would typically move towards:

1.  **Visual Design:** Creating high-fidelity mockups and prototypes based on these textual descriptions.
2.  **Technical Specification:** Detailing the architecture, technologies to be used, and API integrations.
3.  **Development:** Implementation of the application.
4.  **Testing:** Thorough testing of all features and user flows.
5.  **Release and Iteration:** Launching the application and gathering user feedback for future improvements.
