# Unpack - AI and Cloud Features Design

## Introduction

This document details the design specifications for Artificially Intelligent (AI) features and cloud service integrations for the Unpack application. The primary goal is to enhance user experience by providing intelligent assistance, advanced security options, and seamless interaction with popular cloud storage services. These features build upon the designs outlined in the "Unpack - Core Concept and UI Design" and "Unpack - Advanced Features Design" documents, aiming to make Unpack a smarter and more versatile archiving tool.

## Research Summary: AI/Cloud Feature Implementation & UX

Research into existing applications, API documentation, and UX best practices for AI and cloud features provided several key insights that have informed the design of Unpack's intelligent functionalities:

*   **AI-Driven Recommendations (Smart Preset):**
    *   **Presentation:** Effective AI suggestions are contextual, non-intrusive (e.g., dismissible banners/tips), and transparent, briefly explaining the *why* behind a recommendation.
    *   **Interaction:** Users expect to easily accept, dismiss, or customize AI suggestions. Control should remain with the user.
    *   **Balance:** AI should guide and assist, particularly new users, by informing smart defaults or offering optimizations, without rigidly overriding manual choices.

*   **Content-Aware Security Scan (e.g., Google Safe Browsing):**
    *   **Capabilities:** APIs like Google Safe Browsing primarily check URLs against known threat lists (malware, phishing). Direct file content submission by third-party clients is less common; focus is often on URLs within files or hashes of known malicious executables. Services like VirusTotal offer broader file hash checking against multiple AV engines.
    *   **UX for Warnings:** Security warnings should be clear, concise, actionable (e.g., "Extract Anyway (Not Recommended)", "Learn More"), and non-alarmist yet convey the risk appropriately.

*   **OAuth 2.0 and Cloud Storage Browsing (Google Drive/Dropbox):**
    *   **OAuth Flow:** The Authorization Code Grant with PKCE, using the system's default browser, is the standard secure method for desktop applications to obtain access tokens for services like Google Drive and Dropbox. Refresh tokens should be securely stored.
    *   **Display:** Cloud services are typically displayed as separate root nodes in a file browser. Authentication is triggered on first access.
    *   **Error Handling:** Robust handling for API rate limits (exponential backoff), errors (clear messages, retry options), and disconnected states (cached views, offline indicators) is crucial.

*   **Cloud-to-Cloud Operations:**
    *   **Initiation:** Users typically initiate these via context menus or dedicated UI buttons when browsing cloud storage within the app. Clear indication that the operation is cloud-based is important.
    *   **Progress Communication:** Long-running cloud tasks require progress updates via in-app notification centers, system notifications, or status icons. Granularity depends on what the backend/API can provide.
    *   **Status Presentation:** Clear success or failure messages, with actionable advice for errors, are necessary.
    *   **Technical Considerations:** True cloud-native operations (server-side processing without local download/upload) depend heavily on the capabilities of the cloud provider's APIs or require a dedicated Unpack backend service, which has significant architectural and security implications.

These findings have been instrumental in shaping the following feature descriptions, ensuring they align with established patterns and user expectations.

## Intelligent Feature: "Smart Preset" UI & Wording

The "Smart Preset" feature leverages AI to analyze user-selected files for compression and suggests optimal settings, aiming to simplify the decision-making process and improve outcomes based on content type and user goals (e.g., speed vs. size).

### 1. Triggering and Placement of the Recommendation

*   **When:**
    *   The "Smart Preset" recommendation appears after the user has selected files and/or folders and initiates a compression action that leads to the **"Create Archive" dialog** being displayed. This could be via a context menu "Compress to..." action, dragging files into a specific zone in the main Unpack UI, or clicking an "Add to Archive" button that then opens this dialog.

*   **Where (Option A - Preferred):**
    *   The recommendation is displayed as a **clearly identifiable, dismissible info bar section** positioned at the **top of the "Create Archive" dialog**, just below the dialog title and above the tabbed interface ("General", "Advanced", etc.).
    *   This placement ensures high discoverability without disrupting the user's access to manual configuration options below.

*   **Visuals of the Info Bar:**
    *   **Distinct Region:** The info bar is a rectangular area with subtly **rounded corners (e.g., 4-6px)**, spanning the width of the dialog's content area.
    *   **Icon:** A **Segoe Fluent Icon** like `Sparkle` (âœ¨), `Lightbulb` (ðŸ’¡), or `Bot` is displayed prominently on the left side of the info bar.
    *   **Background:** Uses a distinct but non-intrusive background color that differentiates it from the main dialog background.
        *   **Light Theme:** A very soft, light shade of the application's accent color, or a light neutral grey distinct from the main dialog.
        *   **Dark Theme:** A slightly lighter shade of the dark dialog background, or a desaturated, dark version of the accent color.
        *   The background should have a subtle transparency if possible, hinting at the dialog's main background, or be opaque but visually "softer."
    *   **Separator (Optional):** A thin line might visually separate the info bar from the tabs below.

### 2. Content and Wording of the Recommendation

The info bar contains a headline, a brief analysis summary, the primary recommendation with reasoning, an optional alternative, and call-to-action buttons. All text uses **Segoe UI Variable**.

*   **Headline:**
    *   Large, friendly text. (e.g., Segoe UI Variable Semibold, slightly larger than Body text).
    *   Examples: "**âœ¨ Smart Suggestion**" or "**ðŸ’¡ AI Recommendation**"

*   **Analysis Summary:**
    *   Short, easy-to-understand text explaining the basis of the suggestion. (Segoe UI Variable, Body).
    *   **Example 1 (Mixed types, focus on speed):** "Analyzed selection: Contains a mix of document types and many large, pre-compressed images (like JPGs)."
    *   **Example 2 (Focus on max compression):** "Analyzed selection: Detected mostly highly compressible files (e.g., text documents, raw bitmaps)."
    *   **Example 3 (Already compressed types):** "Analyzed selection: Many files appear to be already compressed (e.g., existing ZIP archives, MP4 videos, Office documents)."
    *   **Example 4 (Few small files):** "Analyzed selection: A few small files detected."

*   **Primary Recommendation (with reasoning/benefit):**
    *   Clearly states the suggested settings and their benefit. (Segoe UI Variable, Body. Recommended settings themselves might be bolded).
    *   **Example 1 (Paired with Analysis 1):** "Suggestion for quick archiving: **ZIP format, 'Store' level.** This will group your files rapidly without significant recompression time."
    *   **Example 2 (Paired with Analysis 2):** "Suggestion for maximum space saving: **7z format, 'Ultra' level.** (Estimated ~60% smaller, may take ~2 minutes)."
    *   **Example 3 (Paired with Analysis 3):** "Suggestion for efficient grouping: **ZIP format, 'Store' level.** This avoids lengthy recompression of already compressed content."
    *   **Example 4 (Paired with Analysis 4):** "Suggestion for simplicity: **ZIP format, 'Normal' level.** Balances speed and compression for small items."

*   **Alternative Option (if applicable, offering a trade-off):**
    *   Presented if a clear, common alternative exists. (Segoe UI Variable, Body, perhaps slightly smaller or less emphasized than primary).
    *   **Example 1 (Paired with Primary Rec. 1):** "Alternatively, for more compression (est. ~25% smaller, ~1 min): **7z format, 'Normal' level.**"
    *   **Example 2 (Paired with Primary Rec. 2):** "Alternatively, for faster processing (est. ~40% smaller, ~30 secs): **ZIP format, 'Normal' level.**"
    *   If no strong alternative, this section is omitted to keep the suggestion concise.

*   **Call to Action Buttons/Links:**
    *   Standard Fluent Design buttons, smaller than dialog-level "Create"/"Cancel" buttons.
    *   `[Apply Suggestion]` button:
        *   Primary styled button within the info bar (e.g., accent color fill or prominent outline).
        *   Text: "Apply Suggestion" or "Use These Settings".
    *   `[Dismiss]` icon button:
        *   A small, subtle 'X' icon button (Segoe Fluent Icon: `ChromeClose`) on the far right of the info bar.
        *   Tooltip: "Dismiss suggestion".

### 3. Interaction Flow

*   **Initial State:**
    *   When the "Create Archive" dialog opens (after files are selected for compression), the Smart Preset info bar is visible at the top.
    *   A brief "Analyzing files..." message with a small inline progress indicator (e.g., dots animating) might appear in the info bar for a second or two if analysis isn't instantaneous, then replaced by the actual suggestion.
    *   The compression settings in the dialog tabs below (Archive Format, Compression Level, etc.) are **initially set to user defaults or last used settings**, *not* the AI suggestion.

*   **Applying Suggestion:**
    *   User clicks the `[Apply Suggestion]` button within the info bar.
    *   The relevant controls in the "Create Archive" dialog's tabs (e.g., "Archive Format" dropdown on General tab, "Compression Level" on General tab, potentially "Dictionary Size" on Advanced tab if 7z Ultra is suggested) are **updated to match the primary AI recommendation.**
    *   After applying, the info bar might:
        *   Option A: Show a confirmation: "Suggestion applied! You can still customize settings below." and remain visible.
        *   Option B: Automatically dismiss itself.
        *   Option C (Preferred): The `[Apply Suggestion]` button becomes disabled or changes to "âœ“ Applied", and the bar remains visible until manually dismissed.

*   **Ignoring/Customizing:**
    *   If the user interacts with any of the manual compression setting controls (e.g., changes the "Archive Format" dropdown) *before* clicking `[Apply Suggestion]`, the AI suggestion is considered implicitly ignored for direct application.
    *   The info bar remains visible, allowing the user to still read the suggestion or apply it later (which would then override their manual changes).

*   **Dismissing:**
    *   User clicks the `[Dismiss]` ('X') icon button on the info bar.
    *   The entire Smart Preset info bar section is hidden for the current instance of the "Create Archive" dialog.
    *   The application *may* remember this dismissal for the current session (i.e., if the user closes and reopens the dialog for a new set of files). A global setting to "Enable Smart Suggestions" (on by default) would allow users to turn off the feature entirely.

### 4. Error/Edge Cases (Conceptual)

*   **Analysis Taking Time:**
    *   If file analysis (e.g., checking actual file content signatures for many files) takes more than 1-2 seconds, the info bar should display: "ðŸ”Ž Analyzing files for smart suggestion..." with an indeterminate progress indicator (e.g., `ProgressRing IsIndeterminate="True"`).
    *   If analysis completes quickly, this state might be skipped or flash very briefly.

*   **No Clear Recommendation / Ambiguous Input:**
    *   If the AI cannot determine a confident recommendation (e.g., extremely diverse set of files with no clear pattern, or an error during analysis):
        *   Option A (Preferred): The info bar displays a neutral/helpful message: "No specific suggestion. Please configure settings manually or use defaults." The `[Apply Suggestion]` button would be hidden or disabled.
        *   Option B: The Smart Preset info bar does not appear at all for that session.

*   **Very Few Files / Simple Case:**
    *   The AI might still offer a suggestion, but it could be simpler, e.g., "For these few files, standard ZIP with 'Normal' compression is efficient. [Apply Suggestion]". The "benefit" part of the wording might be less emphasized if the gains are marginal.

### Fluent Design Considerations Summary:

*   **Info Bar Styling:** The suggestion area will use standard Fluent Design principles for layout, spacing, and typography (Segoe UI Variable). Rounded corners and appropriate background colors (respecting light/dark themes and using subtle accent nuances if effective) will be applied.
*   **Controls:** Buttons (`Button`, `HyperlinkButton` for links if any) and icons (Segoe Fluent Icons via `FontIcon` or `SymbolIcon`) will be standard WinUI controls.
*   **Readability & Contrast:** Text will adhere to contrast guidelines for both light and dark themes.
*   **Dismissible Pattern:** The UI for dismissing the suggestion will be clear and follow common patterns (e.g., an 'X' icon).
*   **Responsiveness:** If the dialog is resizable, the info bar content should reflow or truncate gracefully (though dialogs are often fixed size).

## Cloud Integration: "Cloud Decompression" Flowchart (Google Drive to Google Drive)

This section outlines the user flow for decompressing an archive stored in Google Drive directly to another location within the same Google Drive, leveraging Unpack's cloud integration. This functionality relies on prior research into OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication and API interaction for cloud operations. The "Content-Aware Security Scan" research also informs potential security checks that could be integrated into such cloud operations if files are processed through an Unpack-controlled backend.

### Flowchart Description: Cloud Decompression (Google Drive to Google Drive)

This flowchart describes the user and system actions involved when a user decompresses an archive file stored in their Google Drive to another location within the same Google Drive, using Unpack's cloud-integrated features.

*   `[START: User intends to decompress an archive from Google Drive to Google Drive within Unpack]`
*   **Assumed Prerequisites:**
    *   Unpack application is open.
    *   Active internet connection.

*   `-> <USER_ACTION: User navigates to the 'Cloud Drives' section in Unpack's main UI and selects 'Google Drive'.>`
*   `-> (DECISION: Is the Google Drive account currently connected and authorized?)`
    *   `NO -> <UI_INTERACTION: Unpack displays a message: "Google Drive not connected. [Connect to Google Drive] button".>`
    *   `NO -> <USER_ACTION: User clicks the 'Connect to Google Drive' button.>`
    *   `NO -> <SYSTEM_PROCESS: Unpack initiates OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant with PKCE flow.>`
    *   `NO -> <UI_INTERACTION: System's default web browser opens to Google's account chooser and then the OAuth consent screen for Unpack, detailing requested permissions (e.g., view/manage files created by Unpack or specific Drive scopes).>`
    *   `NO -> <USER_ACTION: User logs into their Google account (if not already logged in) and reviews requested permissions. User clicks 'Allow' or 'Grant'.>`
    *   `NO -> <SYSTEM_PROCESS: Google redirects browser to Unpack's local callback URI with an authorization code. Unpack captures this code.>`
    *   `NO -> <SYSTEM_PROCESS: Unpack exchanges the authorization code (and PKCE verifier) for an access token and refresh token from Google. Tokens are securely stored (e.g., Windows Credential Manager).>`
    *   `NO -> (DECISION: OAuth authorization successful?)`
        *   `YES (OAuth Successful) -> <UI_INTERACTION: Success feedback (e.g., "Successfully connected to Google Drive!"). The file browser view now populates with Google Drive contents.>`
        *   `NO (OAuth Failed/Denied/Cancelled) -> <UI_INTERACTION: Error message displayed in Unpack: "Failed to connect to Google Drive. Reason: [Google's error or 'User denied permission' or 'Process cancelled']".>`
        *   `NO (OAuth Failed/Denied/Cancelled) -> [END: Process terminated due to authentication failure.]`
    *   `YES (Already connected) -> <UI_INTERACTION: Google Drive file and folder listing is displayed in Unpack's file browser view.>`

*   `-> <USER_ACTION: User browses their Google Drive folders within Unpack and selects the source archive file (e.g., 'ProjectBackup.zip').>`
*   `-> <USER_ACTION: User right-clicks on the selected 'ProjectBackup.zip' or uses a dedicated button/option in the Unpack UI for cloud operations. Selects 'Cloud Decompress to Google Drive...'.>`
    *   *(Alternative trigger: A 'Cloud Tools' button in the Unpack toolbar becomes active when a cloud file is selected).*

*   `-> <UI_INTERACTION: A modal dialog titled "Cloud Decompression Options" appears. (Fluent Design: rounded corners, themed background).>`
    *   `Dialog Contents:`
        *   `Text: "Source Archive: Google Drive/ProjectBackup.zip"`
        *   `Section: "Select Target Folder in Google Drive"`
        *   `UI Element: A mini Google Drive folder browser tree/list within the dialog.`
        *   `Button: "Create New Folder" (within the mini GDrive browser).`
        *   `Button: "OK" / "Select Folder" (for the mini browser).`
        *   `Button: "Cancel" (for the dialog).`
*   `-> <USER_ACTION: User navigates their Google Drive within the dialog's folder browser, selects a target folder (e.g., 'Extracted Projects'), and clicks "OK" / "Select Folder".>`
    *   *(The dialog might pre-fill a suggested target folder name like 'Google Drive/ProjectBackup/').*

*   `-> <UI_INTERACTION: The "Cloud Decompression Options" dialog updates or a confirmation pop-up appears: "You are about to decompress 'ProjectBackup.zip' to the folder 'Google Drive/Extracted Projects'. This operation will be performed in the cloud. Do you want to proceed?" Buttons: [Start Cloud Decompression], [Cancel].>`
*   `-> <USER_ACTION: User clicks 'Start Cloud Decompression'.>`

*   `-> <SYSTEM_PROCESS: Unpack sends a request to its integrated cloud service backend. The request includes: source Google Drive file ID/path for 'ProjectBackup.zip', target Google Drive folder ID/path for 'Extracted Projects', and the user's Google Drive access token (or the backend uses its own service account with appropriate permissions if architected that way after initial user consent).>`
    *   *(Security Note: Handling user tokens on a backend requires extreme care; service-to-service integrations are often preferred if the backend has its own Google Cloud identity and the user grants permissions to that service identity to act on their behalf for files Unpack manages).*

*   `-> <UI_INTERACTION: Progress is displayed within Unpack's UI, possibly in a dedicated "Cloud Operations" or "Activity Center" panel/toast notifications:`
    *   `Initial: "Cloud decompression of 'ProjectBackup.zip' initiated..."`
    *   `During: "Decompressing 'ProjectBackup.zip' in Google Drive... (Status from service: Processing file X of Y / Verifying / Uploading extracted files...)" - Granularity depends on what the backend service can report.`
    *   `If no granular progress: A generic "Processing in the cloud..." message with an indeterminate progress indicator.`

*   `-> <SYSTEM_PROCESS: The Unpack cloud service uses Google Drive APIs to:`
    *   `1. Access and stream/download 'ProjectBackup.zip'.`
    *   `2. Perform decompression (e.g., using 7-Zip engine on the server).`
    *   `3. Create the target folder 'Extracted Projects' in the user's Google Drive if it doesn't exist.`
    *   `4. Upload/stream the extracted files and folders into 'Google Drive/Extracted Projects'.`
    *   `5. Handle any conflicts or errors during the process (e.g., insufficient cloud storage, API errors).>`

*   `-> (DECISION: Cloud decompression operation on the backend successful?)`
    *   `YES -> <SYSTEM_PROCESS: Backend service reports success to the Unpack client application.>`
    *   `YES -> <UI_INTERACTION: A success notification appears in Unpack: "Cloud decompression of 'ProjectBackup.zip' complete. Files are now available in your Google Drive folder: 'Extracted Projects'." Options: [Open Google Drive Folder in Unpack] (if possible), [Dismiss].>`
    *   `YES -> [END: Cloud decompression task completed successfully. User's files are in the target Google Drive folder.]`
    *   `NO -> <SYSTEM_PROCESS: Backend service reports failure to the Unpack client application, including an error reason if available.>`
    *   `NO -> <UI_INTERACTION: An error notification appears in Unpack: "Cloud decompression of 'ProjectBackup.zip' failed. Reason: [Specific error message, e.g., 'Insufficient Google Drive storage', 'Archive is corrupted', 'Cloud service timeout'].". Options: [Retry (if applicable)], [View Logs (if available)], [Dismiss].>`
    *   `NO -> [END: Cloud decompression task failed.]`

            *   **Option B (Credit Packs):** Users purchase packs of "Cloud Credits". Each cloud-to-cloud operation (e.g., decompressing a 1GB file in the cloud) consumes a certain number of credits based on data size or processing time. Credits could expire after a long period (e.g., 1-2 years) or not at all.
    *   **Multiple Cloud Account Management:** Using more than 1-2 cloud accounts (even for local-to-cloud transfers) might require the cloud add-on subscription.
    *   **Advanced CLI for Cloud:** CLI commands for cloud operations are unlocked with this add-on.

4.  **Target Audience for Premium Features:**
    *   **Unpack Premium Local (One-Time Purchase):** Users who want a powerful, full-featured local archiver with AI assistance and local security scans, and are willing to pay once for a quality desktop tool. They might occasionally use cloud storage for backup/manual transfers.
    *   **Cloud Services Add-on:** Users who heavily leverage cloud storage for archives and require the efficiency of direct cloud-to-cloud operations, businesses performing cloud-based data transformations, users automating cloud workflows.

5.  **Justification/Rationale for the Model:**
    *   **Appeals to "Buy-Once" Users:** The one-time purchase for a robust local client can be very attractive to users who dislike subscriptions for desktop software.
    *   **Direct Cost Recovery for Cloud:** Usage-based credits or a dedicated cloud subscription directly links revenue to the operational costs of providing server-side cloud operations (API calls, bandwidth, compute).
    *   **Flexibility:** Users only pay for cloud features if they need them. Infrequent cloud users aren't burdened with subscription costs for features they don't use.
    *   **Clear Separation:** Differentiates between the value of the local software and the value/cost of ongoing cloud services.
    *   **Credit packs can incentivize larger upfront purchases** and can feel less like a recurring burden than a subscription for some users, especially if usage is sporadic.

## Conclusion

The AI-driven "Smart Preset" feature, alongside comprehensive cloud integrations including direct cloud-to-cloud operations and robust security scanning, significantly enhances Unpack's value proposition. These features are designed to be both powerful and intuitive, aligning with the application's core philosophy. The exploration of various business models provides a pathway for sustainable development and cost recovery for these advanced, often resource-intensive, functionalities.

Potential next steps include creating detailed visual mockups for the Smart Preset info bar and any new UI elements related to cloud integration (e.g., cloud browser sections, activity centers). Prototyping these features, particularly the OAuth flows and the user experience for cloud operations, will be crucial. Further technical investigation into specific API integrations and backend architecture for cloud operations will also be necessary.
